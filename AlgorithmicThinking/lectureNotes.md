Time and Space Complexity within a software or program
    Time complexity means how many instructions have to be run to complete this program?
        Counting the operations 
    
    Space complexity
        What is memory on a computer? It is where the the information is stored in byte-structure in RAM (Random Access Memory)
            -ROM (Read Only Memory)
            
            How many o or 1s can be stored at any time
            Represented in RAM 
        How many of the bytes in the RAM is required to complete the algorithm?

        Or retained for use. 

Big O Notation - concise way to record those bits of information
    Time complexity is seperate from space complexity

Link's Kitchen would be a good activity to practice this on. 


Nested for loop = quadratic time complexity.

Nested Nested loops are n^4
