## Definitions:
    *Algorithm: a step-by-step process or a set of rules/instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a specified problem. 

    *Recursive Algorithm: a method where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems. It relies on a base case to stop the recursion and avoid infinite loops. 
        Ex: Merge sort algorithm when applied to finding a name in a directory.

    *Bubble Sort Algorithm: a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list or array, comparing adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The last items "bubble up" as the algorithm runs repeatedly, meaning they do not need to be checked as they are in the right position.

## Key Characteristics of Algorithms
* Finiteness: An algorithm **must terminate** after a finite number of steps.
* Definiteness: Each step **must be precisely defined** and unambiguous. 
* Input: An algorithm **must take zero or more inputs**.
* Output: An algorithm **produces one or more outputs**.
* Effectiveness: Each step **must be basic enough to be carried out by a person using only a pencil and paper**


## Why Algorithms Matter
* They provide efficient solutions to complex problems
* The form the basis of all computer programs
* They enable us to analyze and compare different approaches to problem solving
* They help us understand the limitations and capabilities of computing
