## The Five Steps to Problem Solving

### 1. Clarify
Make sure you understand the problem before you attempt to solve it. 
* Ask questions to eliminate ambiguities (never assume anything)
* Identify the inputs and expected outputs
* Understand and list the constraints and possible edge cases.
* Restate the problem in your own words to ensure you have an handle on it.
* Consider example scenarios

### 2. Plan
Before you write any code, make sure you have a plan for solving the problem.
* Break down the problem into smaller chunks
* Choose appropriate data structures
* Outline the algorithmic steps you plan to take
* Consider multiple approaches and their tradeoffs (potentially ask additional clarifying questions)
* Sketch out pseudocode or flowcharts if they are helpful

### 3. Implement
Begin executing your plan into actual code.
* Write clean, readable code (including comments if you find them helpful)
* Follow best-practices for programming
* Use meaningful variable and function names

### 4. Test
Verify that your solution works correctly.
* Test with example inputs
* Check edge cases such as empty inputs, large values, etc.
* Trace through the code manually
* Debug any issues that arise
* Verify that the solution meets all the requirements outlined

### 5. Optimize
Improve your solution for efficiency and readability
* Analyze time and space complexity
* Identify bottlenecks
* Refactor code for better performance
* Consider alternative algorithms or data structures
* Balance readability with performance
