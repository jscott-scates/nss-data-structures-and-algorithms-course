## Definitions
- **Stack:** A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Understanding Stack Operations
- **.push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack (end of the array)
- **.pop**: Removes the last element on the top of the stack (end of the array)
- **.peek**: Checks the element without removing the element from the stack.
- **.isEmpty**: Checks if your stack / array is empty
- **.size**: Counts the number of elements within a stack

All of the above operations have a time complexity of O(1) or constant time complexity.

**Stacks are perfect to use when the order does not matter**

Real-world applications include: 
- undo systems
- function calls in programming
- browser history
