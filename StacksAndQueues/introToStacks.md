## Definitions
- **Stack:** A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Understanding Stack Operations
- **.push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack (end of the array)
- **.pop**: Removes the last element on the top of the stack (end of the array)
- **.peek**: Checks the element without removing the element from the stack.

**Stacks are perfect to use when the order does not matter**
