## Definitions
- Queue: Used when the order matters, First In First Out
- Enqueue: adding an element to a queue at the end of the queue

## Queues
- Require that you work at both the front (where you remove elements) and the end (where you add new elements)

## Understanding Queue Operations
- **.push** or enqueue when you add and element to the end of the array or queue
- **.shift** or dequeue when you remove the first element at the beginning of the array or queue
- **.peek[0]** peeks at the first element in the array or queue
- **.isEmpty** checks to see if the array or queue is empty
- **.size** returns the number of elements in the queue
