// Build a FIFO that handles priority passes going to the front of the queue

//Class would contain two lists of arrays
    //priority pass
    //pleabians 
    //if priority pass !== null load people 
    //else load plebians

//Single line that checks the key value pairs, if it has a priority pass it would move to the front but then check each item in the front and place them after the last priority person

//Linked list where you can insert a new priority list
