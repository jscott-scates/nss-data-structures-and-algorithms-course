## When to Choose Each Implementation
### Simple Array Queue:
- Small data sets (<100 items)
- Prototype or educational code
- Team has limited experience
- Performance is not critical
- Implementation time is very limited

### Circular Array Queue:
- Medium to large data sets 
- Performance is important
- Memory efficiency matters
- Team can handle moderate complexity
- Long-term maintenance is planned

### Linked List Queue:
- Highly variable data set sizes
- Memory is abundant
- Dynamic sizing is crucial
- Team is experienced with pointers
- No capacity planning is possible

## Complexity Investment Analysis
### Simple Implementation:
- Low upfront cost
- High operational cost (slow performance)
- High debugging cost (performance issues)
- High user frustration cost

### Complex Implementation:
- High upfront cost
- Low operational cost (fast performance)
- Medium debugging cost (logic issues)
- Low user frustration cost
