# Key Insights About Stack Implementation

## Why Arrays Work Well for Stacks
- Natural LIFO behavior: Adding/removing from the end is natural
- Efficient operations: All stack operations are O(1)
- Simple implementation: JavaScript arrays have built-in push/pop methods
- Memory efficient: No extra pointers or complex structures needed

## Best Practices
- Always check for empty stack before popping or peeking
- Provide clear error messages for edge cases
- Use descriptive method names that match the domain (addBook vs push)
- Include helpful logging for debugging and understanding

## When to Use This Implementation
- Known maximum size: When you have a rough idea of how big the stack will get
- Memory efficiency matters: Arrays use less memory than linked structures
- Simple operations: When you only need basic stack functionality
