## Array Methods
- .map() uses O(n) time complexity as it visits each item in the array and transforms it. 
- .forEach() when something needs to be performed on each item in the array but not create a new array.
- .reduce() reduces a set of data into a single value whether that be a total, average, or a complex object with statistics.
- .slice() alls you to extract exactly the data you need without changing the original data.
