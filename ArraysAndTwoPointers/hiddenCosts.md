## Understanding Array Performance Tradeoffs

### Scale Reality
- Operations that feel instant with small data sets can become noticeably slow with large data sets
- O(1) operations stay fast regardless of size. Operations include .push(), .pop(), array[index]
- O(n) operations get slower as data grows. Operations include .unshift(), .shift(), .splice()

### Hidden Costs
- Inserting at the beginning requires shifting all existing elements within an array
- Deleting from the beginning requires shifting ALL remaining elements
- The closer to the beginning the more expensive the operation costs become

### Strategic Solutions
- Design systems to favor fast operations (push / pop) over slow ones (shift/ unshift)
- Use separate data structures for different access patterns
- Batch operations when possible to reduce total; shifting
- Consider maps for fast lookups instead of indexOf()

### Performance Driven Design
- Always measure real performance, not just theoretical complexity
- Small Arrays: prioritize code readability
- Large Arrays: design around performance constraints
- Very Large Arrays: consider alternative data structures entirely
